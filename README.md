## Adding Astra Docker Template on Unraid OS

### Prerequisites
Before deploying Astra, ensure you have the necessary license and configuration files available:

- **License File:** Ensure you have a valid Astra license and place it at the following path on your Unraid server:
  ```
  /mnt/user/appdata/astra/license.txt
  ```
- **Configuration File:** Name your configuration file uniquely if you intend to run multiple Astra containers. Place the configuration file(s) at the following path on your Unraid server:
  ```
  /mnt/user/appdata/astra/astra-[your-unique-name].conf
  ```
  Replace `[your-unique-name]` with a descriptor or name that is relevant to your setup (e.g., `astra-DVB-T.conf`, `astra-DVB-S.conf`, etc.)

### Step 1: Open Unraid Terminal
Navigate to your Unraid web interface, typically located at `http://[YourUnraidIP]`. On the bottom right of the dashboard, you should find a "Terminal" button. Click on it to open a web-based terminal.

### Step 2: Execute the Script
Copy the following command and paste it into the Unraid web terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/user/appdata/astra/ && touch /mnt/user/appdata/astra/astra.conf && bash <(wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrgs83/mrgs-docked-astra/main/download_template.sh)
```
This command will download and execute the script directly, placing the Astra Docker template in the appropriate directory on your Unraid server.

### Step 3: Add the Docker Container
After successfully running the script:
- Navigate to the "Docker" tab in your Unraid web interface.
- Click on "Add Container".
- Find and select `Astra` in the "Template" dropdown menu under the "Docker Containers" section.
- Fill in the required details as per your setup needs.
- Specify the paths to your unique configuration file and license in the template fields.
- Click "Apply" to run the Astra Docker Container.

🔐 **Security Note:** Running scripts directly from the web is a potential security risk. Ensure that you trust the source (in this case, the GitHub repository) before executing any scripts in your environment.

🛠 **Troubleshooting:** If you face any issues or if the template doesn’t appear, check the Unraid logs for any error messages and verify the path and URL in the script are accurate.

This guide, which includes a section about the prerequisites for using license and configuration files, can be added to the `README.md` of your GitHub repository, ensuring users are well-informed about the setup process. Always ensure to validate file paths and instructions periodically, ensuring they are up to date with both Astra and Unraid updates.
